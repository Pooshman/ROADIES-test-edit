Host:    raptor.ucsd.edu (AVX512, FMA3, 376 GB RAM)
Command: iqtree -s test/msa/gene_aln_117.fa -m GTR+F -redo
Seed:    950274 (Using SPRNG - Scalable Parallel Random Number Generator)
Time:    Thu Sep 15 00:34:55 2022
Kernel:  AVX+FMA - 1 threads (64 CPU cores detected)

HINT: Use -nt option to specify number of threads because your CPU has 64 cores!
HINT: -nt AUTO will automatically determine the best number of threads to use.

Reading alignment file test/msa/gene_aln_117.fa ... Fasta format detected
Alignment most likely contains DNA/RNA sequences
Alignment has 156 sequences with 2935 columns, 2274 distinct patterns
1733 parsimony-informative, 341 singleton sites, 861 constant sites
