Host:    raptor.ucsd.edu (AVX512, FMA3, 376 GB RAM)
Command: iqtree -s test/msa/gene_aln_163.fa -m GTR+F -redo
Seed:    272240 (Using SPRNG - Scalable Parallel Random Number Generator)
Time:    Thu Sep 15 00:37:37 2022
Kernel:  AVX+FMA - 1 threads (64 CPU cores detected)

HINT: Use -nt option to specify number of threads because your CPU has 64 cores!
HINT: -nt AUTO will automatically determine the best number of threads to use.

Reading alignment file test/msa/gene_aln_163.fa ... Fasta format detected
Alignment most likely contains DNA/RNA sequences
Alignment has 93 sequences with 1747 columns, 1385 distinct patterns
1098 parsimony-informative, 187 singleton sites, 462 constant sites
