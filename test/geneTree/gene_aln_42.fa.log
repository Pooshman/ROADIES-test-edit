Developed by Bui Quang Minh, Nguyen Lam Tung, Olga Chernomor,
Heiko Schmidt, Dominik Schrempf, Michael Woodhams.

Host:    raptor.ucsd.edu (AVX512, FMA3, 376 GB RAM)
Command: iqtree -s test/msa/gene_aln_42.fa -m GTR+F -redo
Seed:    626818 (Using SPRNG - Scalable Parallel Random Number Generator)
Time:    Thu Sep 15 00:36:22 2022
Kernel:  AVX+FMA - 1 threads (64 CPU cores detected)

HINT: Use -nt option to specify number of threads because your CPU has 64 cores!
HINT: -nt AUTO will automatically determine the best number of threads to use.

Reading alignment file test/msa/gene_aln_42.fa ... Fasta format detected
Alignment most likely contains DNA/RNA sequences
Alignment has 71 sequences with 1483 columns, 668 distinct patterns
736 parsimony-informative, 18 singleton sites, 729 constant sites
