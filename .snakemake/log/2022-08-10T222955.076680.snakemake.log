Relative file path './sequence_select/out.fasta' starts with './'. This is redundant and strongly discouraged. It can also lead to inconsistent results of the file-matching approach used by Snakemake. You can simply omit the './' for relative file paths.

Error in rule sequence_select:
    jobid: 1
    output: ./sequence_select/out.fasta
    shell:
        ./sequence_select/get_seq.sh ./sequence_select/index.csv ./get_genomes/small_genomes ./sequence_select/out.fasta
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job sequence_select since they might be corrupted:
./sequence_select/out.fasta
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
