Error in rule astral:
    jobid: 1
    output: test/speciesTree.newick
    shell:
        java -Djava.library.path=A-pro/ASTRAL-MP/lib -jar A-pro/ASTRAL-MP/astral.1.1.6.jar -i test/geneTree/gene_tree_merged.newick -o test/speciesTree.newick -a mapping.txt --polylimit 3
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job astral since they might be corrupted:
test/speciesTree.newick
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
