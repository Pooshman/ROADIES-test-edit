It allows multi-copy gene trees (inferred from homologous regions) and does not require the challenging and error-prone step of orthologous detection prior to gene tree inference. </li> <li>Alignment-free: ROADIES does not require any input alignment to be provided, as all alignments required for gene tree inference are constructed within the ROADIES pipeline itself.</li> <li>Discordance-aware: Instead of single-copy genes, ROADIES considers multi-copy genes while analyzing species tree and takes care of the possible gene discordances such as paralogs, horizonal gene transfer, incomplete lineage sorting. It uses a state-of-the-art and statistically consistent discordance-aware method to combine gene trees into a species tree.</li> <li>Scalability: ROADIES handles both small-scale and large-scale datasets efficiently, including diverse life forms such as mammals, flies, and birds. ROADIES also scales efficiently with multiple cores and produces faster results.</li> <li>Flexibility: ROADIES allows users to tune the tradeoff between accuracy and runtime by configuring the parameters and tailoring the pipeline to their specific needs.</li> <li>Debugging options: ROADIES provides multiple plots as output for graphical analysis, making it easier for the user to debug. </li> </ul>"},{"location":"#roadies-pipeline-overview","title":"ROADIES Pipeline Overview","text":"<p>ROADIES pipeline consists of multiple stages, from raw genome assemblies to species tree estimation, with several user-configurable parameters in each stage. </p> <ul> <li>Stage 1: Random Sampling: ROADIES randomly samples a configured number of subsequences from input genomic assemblies.

It performs multiple iterations of the entire pipeline and stops if it gets the confident tree, otherwise it continues with more gene counts.

REFERENCE (optional) Specify the path for the reference tree (state-of-the-art) in Newick format to compare ROADIES' results with a state-of-the-art approach. If you don't want to specify any reference tree, set it to <code>NULL</code>. <code>NULL</code> LENGTH Configure the lengths of each of the randomly sampled subsequences or genes. 500 GENE_COUNT Configure the number of genes to be sampled across all input genome assemblies. In normal mode, this will be the count of the genes to be sampled. In <code>--converge</code> mode, this will be the initial count of the number of genes for the first iteration and this value will be doubled iteratively. 250 UPPER_CASE Configure the lower limit threshold of upper cases for valid sampling. ROADIES samples the genes only if the percentage of upper cases in each gene is more than this value. 0.9 (Recommended) OUT_DIR Specify the path for ROADIES output files (this saves the current iteration results in converge mode). ALL_OUT_DIR Specify the path for ROADIES output files for all iterations in converge mode. MIN_ALIGN Specify the minimum number of allowed species to exist in gene fasta files after LASTZ. This parameter is used for filtering gene fasta files which has very less species representation. It is recommended to set the value greater than or equal to 4 since ASTRAL-Pro follows a quartet-based topology for species tree inference. For larger evolutionary timescales, we recommended setting it to a much higher value. In such cases, 15 to 20 would be a good start. 4 COVERAGE Set the percentage of input sequence included in the alignment for LASTZ. 85 CONTINUITY Define the allowable percentage of non-gappy alignment columns for LASTZ. 85 IDENTITY Set the percentage of the aligned base pairs (matches/mismatches) for LASTZ. For larger evolutionary timescales, consider lowering the identity values than default for more homologous hits to be encountered. 65 MAX_DUP Specify maximum number of allowed gene copies from one input genome in an alignment. 10 STEPS Specify the number of steps in the LASTZ sampling (increasing number speeds up alignment but decreases LASTZ accuracy). 1 FILTERFRAGMENTS Specify the portion so that sites with less than the specified portion of non-gap characters in PASTA alignments will be masked out. If it is set to 0.5, then sites with less than 50% of non-gap characters will be masked out. 0.5 MASKSITES Specify the portion so that sequences with less than the specified portion of non-gap sequences will be removed in PASTA alignment. If it is set to 0.05, then sequences having less than 5% of non-gap characters (i.e., more than 95% gaps) will be masked out. 0.02 SUPPORT_THRESHOLD Specify the threshold so that support values with equal to or higher than this threshold is considered as highly supported node. Such highly supported nodes crossing this threshold will be counted at every iteration to check the confidence of the tree (works in <code>--converge</code> mode). 0.95 NUM_INSTANCES Specify the number of instances for PASTA, LASTZ, MashTree and RAxML-NG to run in parallel.
